# YouTube-Download

This project is a Python script that allows you to download YouTube videos by directly pasting the link and selecting the destination folder. The code is written in Python, and I used the Tkinter library to design the interface. Additionally, the script allows you to download both individual videos and playlists if you provide the corresponding link.
